        <description>From the kickstarter:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alice is Missing, a silent role-playing
            game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town
            of Silent Falls.&amp;#10;...&amp;#10;The game is played live and without verbal
            communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play
            session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other
            characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren&amp;rsquo;t in
            the same place together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher's blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game
            is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the
            entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back
            and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though
            they aren&amp;rsquo;t in the same place together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Haunting beautiful,
            deeply personal, and highly innovative Alice is Missing puts a strong focus on the
            emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that
            unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another. Right at home
            with games like Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, and Firewatch, it&amp;rsquo;s
            designed to feel as much like an event-style experience as it does a role-playing game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

My only reluctance on scoring this higher is replayability. There story driving cards branch to give different outcomes. But I am afraid there aren&apos;t enough different prompts to give a completely unique story each time, especially with the same group." />

                value="A strange &quot;RPG&quot;. It spends an inordinate number of pages warning the player of a potentially traumatic experience but there is no substance to back up those warnings.

The feelies are bizarre, too. There are print-out posters that serve very little purpose. There&apos;s a timer video that is simply a soundtrack. Its entire mechanical purpose is to ensure the players are aware of when certain key time intervals have passed and it doesn&apos;t even audibly alert you to that. It&apos;s just music and a timer. In fact, the only thing it does alert you to is a handful of jarring music transitions that don&apos;t even match up to the game&apos;s key time intervals.

This isn&apos;t even a game where you are invited to be the coauthor of a story, like more traditional RPGs. Instead, you are simply an actor acting out what you are told to do by a series of cards.

I found this game to offer a mundane story about mundane people which the game insists you go through a rigmarole to help make the experience more immersive. It does not do this. Instead, all it does is annoy everyone at the table as they have to rename their contacts in their phone, rename them back at the end of the game, listen to a bewilderingly dramatic soundtrack for ninety minutes, stay silent the whole time, and go through a ton of rules explanation when the whole game amounts to flipping cards when you&apos;re told to do so. The game even demands everyone debrief about their experience after the game as if they had just been to a group counseling session. It&apos;s so bizarre.

The characters you portray are not yours. You are simply the actor conveying who they&apos;ve already been decided to be via a deck of cards. And, at least for me, who they are is not compelling enough to want to play this game again." />
