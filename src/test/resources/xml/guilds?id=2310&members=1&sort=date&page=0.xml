    <description>Welcome to the St Albans Board Game Club. We are a friendly bunch and meet every week in two locations and also we hold monthly all day events which are open to all.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;The club is a place where like-minded individuals with a passion for strategy, tactics and gaming can come together to enjoy their hobby. The Monday events are held every two weeks 7pm – 11pm at the St Mark's Church, Church Lane, Colney Heath, St Albans, Hertfordshire AL4.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;The Wednesday events are held every two weeks 7pm – 11pm at the 3rd St Albans Scout Hut Oak Yard, Chene Drive, Waverley Road, St Albans, AL3 5PE. The dates alternate with the next one 27th May and so on.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;We also hold monthly game days at the same Scout Hut and these run from 1pm – 11pm and involve lots of gaming of all types of games. The next all day event is 27th June.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;The week nights are £2 and the all day game events are £5. This covers the hire of the halls.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;We are more than happy to teach people games and help people through so please don't be worried about coming if you are new to board games.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;Feel free to bring your games or just come along and play what is there. We play anything from quick easy card games to 3 hour long epics and anything in between.
        &lt;br/&gt;
