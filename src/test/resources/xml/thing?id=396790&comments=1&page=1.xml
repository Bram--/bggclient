        <description>When Elsa von Fr&amp;uuml;hlingfeld presented her invention to King Frederik
            Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated
            element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power an
            engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called &amp;ldquo;atomization.&amp;rdquo;
            Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the next
            decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science and
            engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power,
            demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby
            country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry the
            tamed power of the atoms to Saxony&amp;rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers, and
            industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new industrial
            revolution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players take
            role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological boom of
            19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a nuclear
            reactor).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players earn victory points by developing their networks,
            building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones
            (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies, giving
            them special powers when unlocked. Gameplay is continuous; players take turns one after
            another with no rounds or phases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the
            publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

                value="First impressions. Strong title. Has a very Brass-esque feel with the network building, although things work differently and I do think I still prefer Brass. I liked how the mechanisms worked together, with contracts feeding into technologies and technologies enabling more energy production. There were interesting decision-making around when to refresh and definitely a lot of interesting ideas. I have enough similar titles that I don&apos;t need to own it, but I would happily play it again." />

                value="This game is amazing.

Turns are fairly quick despite the decision space, and fiddliness is marginal.  There are many helpful graphical rules reminders on all the boards and the iconography is easy to understand.

The AI is very easy to run and comes with a near-comprehensive aid on the back of the solo rulebook.  Figuring out where the AI will build is the thinky-est procedure, but it is far simpler than in Barrage.

Nucleum is far less cutthroat than Barrage because there is little worker placement blockage. You can always do what you want as long as you have the tile and can pay for it, and it&apos;s not often that you are boxed in or out of a network.  There is also no randomness as far as power sources go (i.e. Barrage&apos;s water placement tiles)." />

                value="I was very excited to play this after all of the hype and the Brass meets Barrage comparisons.

My opinion likely goes against the majority on here, but I found Nucleum only okay.  There is definitely some fun to be had and I liked how the action tiles worked.  Beyond that, the game has a ton of rules, many which aren&apos;t intuitive, and is not easy to learn despite not being particularly heavy.

I think that once the hotness wears off, this won&apos;t have the staying power of Brass or Barrage.  I&apos;d play either of those games over this every time.  Barrage in particular is a masterpiece and directly fires this for me.

Euros continue to go in the wrong direction in my opinion.  More of everything...more rules, more pieces, more setup, more iconography, more things to track, more play time, more AP potential, etc.  More of everything except depth and fun." />

                value="I’ve got to think about this one. I like it better than Brass for game play. Maybe because my plans are less dependent on drawing the right card and it’s got fewer rules wiggles in it. But I REALLY hate the scoring and the components aren’t nearly as nice even after my upgrades.

Counting the buildings afterwards just seems like a good way to miss things. Same thing with how capital buildings score. On the good side tho you can get right to the building you want and you can typically get right to the town you want with less muss and fuss.

One other thing, this is described as the love child of Brass and Barrage, but I’m missing the Barrage DNA. And absolutely do not play this with 4 people, it drags. I started at a 8, I&apos;ve bumped up to an 8.5. Really solid game but honestly if you love Brass you may not have room in your collection for it." />

Even though it looks tempting, I believe it would see fewer play opportunities compared to Brass Birmingham. Additionally, I haven’t yet played Barrage or Concordia, and I’d like to try those out first.

Nucleum would be born!

This is the kind of intricate, crunchy, interactive meaty euro I am falling in love for these days.

At its core, there is a clever action selection system: you can play an action tile at the top of your board, using both its actions OR you can play an action tile on the main board as rails, triggering zero, one or both actions, depending on matching colors with other elements on the board. If you do the latter, you will expand your network, but you will also lose your action tile for the rest of the game!
If you’re not willing or capable to use an action tile, you can recharge: you will recover your tiles (minus those on the main board), and you will also place one of your stars on a track, measuring how much you had powered up stuff between recharges…

The game has various buildings, two ways (coal and uranium) to activate power stations and energize buildings, various way to develop (in different ways) each player’s board…. and a bit of interaction on the main board!

The obvious drawback of the game is its very long teaching time, and some counterintuitive stuff (the defining network, among other things).
But, after a couple of turns, everything clicks and the game catches speed and ramps quite nicely towards the endgame.

Tentative rating is 8, but could go up…" />

Much of the tension comes down to those action dominoes, and how and when to play them out onto the board.  Do you always try to optimize to get both actions potentially, perhaps giving another player an action they wish to take? or do you prioritize making the connection." />

                value="With today&apos;s post, the Ministry would like to commemorate the breakthrough in nuclear energy research made by Elsa von Frühlingsfeld in a parallel universe in 19th century Saxony.

In the new title Nucleum by the well-known duo Luciano and Turci, the aim is to build networks and buildings on a map by laying pieces of track and ultimately supplying them with energy so that they can be turned over for bonuses and endgame points. The game is controlled by an action selection mechanism on its own bureate board. This is also slightly asymmetrical due to various &quot;experiments&quot;. While the expansion is reminiscent of networks in Brass, the feel of the game differs significantly. The confrontation is not as strong here and it is easier to spread out. At the same time, resource management and the action mechanism give a lot of room for accentuating the game strategy.

&quot;I am thrilled!&quot;, said the minister after the first game. And if three hours had not already passed after the explanation of the rules and the game with three people, he could have started the next game directly to discover the game even further.&quot;Admittedly, however, the game also triggers the right points in him,&quot; his assistant said afterwards. The theme is very pleasing, the game sufficiently complex, but the speed of play nevertheless high.Therefore, the 9 could well become a 10 if it has enough variability to be played often." />

                value="I have 6+ plays on this game and still want to play again. I&apos;ve tried all player counts and it works perfectly in every single player count. My only two gripes with the game are 1, the set up and put away are awful. The game comes with a makeshift organizer and it&apos;s super bad. Had to buy my own components to put away and it&apos;s still bad. 2, factions A, C, and D are very good but B is mid. Not bad but not amazing. The game is complicated but not in the actions or mechanics but in the potential strategies you can come up with. It gives you creative control and let&apos;s you explore and improvise. That being said, you do need to have a strong starting strategy, if you pivot in the middle of the game or have a weak start, then other players who have a good momentum going through the whole gave will win. The improvisation comes in at the end game where people take your actions or do something unexpected and you have to scramble and quickly find points in anyway or try and do the same action as planned in a different way. I would have given it a 10 out of 10 if it at least came with an organizer like the gallerist or at the very least feast of Odin or ark nova." />

                value="This is a very good game that I don&apos;t really want to play again. Barrage and Brass are much better.

The game is very crunchy and deep, but is extremely prone to Analysis Paralysis. The problem is that the way to do actions is via some domino pieces that you need to buy and puzzle out, and that means that when you want to chain actions you have to do some complex thinking of how to play the dominoes, which many times forces you to make weird maneuvers.

The game starts good, and you have a lot of fun building around, but then the end game is horrible because you need to squeeze points.

Then I have a problem that the board is too big and you have little interaction, and then you do a bit of everything in each game, so you don&apos;t feel you&apos;re really specializing, but rather just solving the action puzzle in different ways.

At some point the analysis paralysis frustrated me and made me want to resign. In my opinion that complexity is unnecessary. I think the game would be super fun if all dominoes where wildcards, and all the colors matched. I&apos;m tempted to try it again with that house rule." />

                value="Turczi is almost as bad as Lacerda. (Maybe worse -  Tawatinsuyu, and  Tekhenu were awful too).

Micro details for the sake of “design”.
And all overwrought in a genre I loathe (find the best train network).

Practically a poster child for all that’s wrong with euro gaming these days.
Themeless, soulless, no replayability beyond 1 or 2 plays until the next similar title becomes flavour of the month.

“Heavy euros” that are so bloated they drown in their own vomit." />

Nothing original at all in this one but it all fits nice together, could easily remove some of the stuff to make it a bit cleaner. On the whole a lot of nicely fit together mechanics." />

                value="First impressions . . . much lighter than rated here on BGG.  I generally eschew direct comparisons, but found it ripe to ask whether this title replaces Brass . . . it certainly scratches that itch.  Though Wallace is my favorite designer, I&apos;m lukewarm on Brass.  In that context, Nucleum struck me as superior, adding some layering that seemed to work well." />

                value="In Werner Herzog&apos;s voice:

Fiddliness reigns.  The first challenge your soul must endure is the set-up.  You wait with your player board as your dazed comrades create a perfect circular vortex of cardboard bits and anger that encompasses the massive footprint of the game and the drabness of the board.  Once you start the game, you realize this is a false achievement; you discover that the rules, once daunting, then simple, generate complexity again as you toss the rulebook around without any thought or plan.  Turns once begun are quickly abandoned, players seemingly immune to goal-oriented thinking.  At last, the game opens up and cardboard bits scramble like beetles whose rock has been upended.  It is a grotesque parody of war game and scrapbooking, as if cardboard had be granted only the amount of sentience required to mock humanity.  The requirements for energizing, the most important of your actions, are not labeled and you most search for every rule.  The constantly fumbling causes a numbness that borders on profound despair.  Your conscious mind registers merely annoyance, impatience.  But on a cellular level, your body cries out in weariness.  Millions of years of evolution trying to save you from becoming mired in the tar, from sinking into the warm blackness and ultimately being reclaimed by the Earth itself.  Be sure to complete your Level 3 achievements.

4 Stars." />

                value="Nucleum strikes the perfect balance between an interactive economic game and a modern multiplayer solitaire euro. I am still surprised at how well it pulls it off. A Brass lover (such as myself) can enjoy the game alongside a Great Western Trail lover (such as my wife) and both kinds of players can appreciate different aspects of the design. Its also  one of the few heavy euros where all the rules just make sense to me and I&apos;m not worried about forgetting them.

I don&apos;t love this one as much as Brass (Lancashire, of course... Birmingham is an abomination), but it has entered the echelon of my favorite modern euro designs, standing alongside On Mars, Madeira, and Imperial Steam." />

                value="I went into playing Nucleum with low expectations - an overcomplicated and long variation on Brass? Why not just play Brass? But that undersells this game quite a bit. There is some very distinct and cool aspects to this game, and it doesn&apos;t feel like Brass at all to me. The learning curve is pretty steep, but well worth the investment." />

I really like the choices between playing tiles along the top of your board or converting to railway pieces. The way networks work also feels pretty intuitive and fun. There&apos;s a lot to think about throughout your turns. The game is a bit of a point salad, but it also feels pretty approachable for teaching new players -- it hits a nice balance for me." />

Not as good as the games it gets compared to (Brass, Barrage), but if you have played those games a lot and are looking for something new then this is good. AP prone players will push the play time to 4ish hours, be warned. Long set up too." />
