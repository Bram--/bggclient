        <description>A boxed set of 5 Data CD's that includes up to issue 250 of Dragon Magazine in
            PDF format&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the introduction to the manual:&amp;#10;Welcome to the
            DRAGON Magazine Archive, a compendium of the first 250 issues of DRAGON Magazine. On
            this set of CDs is every article, every story, every dungeon, every statistic and every
            illustration that appeared in issues 1 to 250 of DRAGON Magazine, plus all seven issues
            of The Strategic Review (the forerunner to DRAGON Magazine). You can flip through the
            Archive page by page, use the Search features to scour the Archive for specific words or
            articles, and even bookmark articles you want to refer back to on a regular basis. Not
            only is the DRAGON Magazine Archive a great gaming resource, but reading through the
            early issues can be both nostalgic and entertaining! So sit back, and enjoy the ultimate
            dragon horde!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;

Well scanned and searchable - although the material is for editions of D&amp;D prior to 3rd, there is still a ton of great advice and adventure ideas, hooks and equipment to last someone a lifetime." />

                value="This set is a treasure.

Having access to the first 250 issues of Dragon, plus all seven issues of The Strategic Review, is wonderful. And they&apos;re searchable, portable, and printable, which rocks. Dragon holds a lot of good memories for me, and a ton of great content for 2e and older editions of D&amp;D, and having this much of it in one place feels almost too good to be true.

The scans aren&apos;t perfect, and unfortunately it tends to be the color artwork that suffers the most -- including the covers. But the text is crisp and clear, which is what matters most to me.

I didn&apos;t bother with the software, just the PDFs." />
