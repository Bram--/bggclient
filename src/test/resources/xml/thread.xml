            <subject>New Maps for Ark Nova + Marine World</subject>
            <body>Hi. Here are 3 new maps for the community: Explorers Zoo, Ark Nova and Development Biology Center.&lt;br/&gt;They are still in testing but as for now the first 2 seem to be balanced. The DBC requires more testing and may yet be sligtly nerfed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here they are with more detailed info on symbols and FAQ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Explorers Zoo:&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7914280"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6LqizFVCXi4xnQr3iQosOw__small/img/yY9UaBf6FNcFK--wPVTT3KteTR8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7914280.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By covering the zoo tiles with the &quot;Placement Symbol&quot; you progress through the &quot;Explorers Track&quot; (placed in the lower left corner). For each covered &quot;Placement Symbol&quot; place a token from your token pool (unused cubes of your color) on the LEFTMOST empty space. If when placing the token you've covered a reward, gain it. The &quot;Search Icon&quot; allows you to choose an animal type. If you do, place a cube on that animal type symbol on &quot;Explorers Track&quot; and do a Search Action (same as when gaining a Univeristy with an animal type).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you will be able to search for a maximum of 3 animals. Each must be of a different Animal Type. The already searched Animal Types can be tracked by placing tokens on Animal Types on &quot;Explorers Track&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that there are only 6  &quot;Placement Symbol&quot; tiles on the zoo map. In order to Search for a 3rd animal type the player must gain the 7th token in a different way.&lt;br/&gt;It can be gained by either map's unique Conservation Bonus (along with 1 reputation) or by using other cards effects (f.e. Archeologist, or Excavation Site)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Ark Nova&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7914325"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2_V2lrnK8kXdvzTRWJyYSA__small/img/J_jWilw142HWdp3tASAzQ9VCF8Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7914325.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Zoo allows you to build and populate an actual Ark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the zoo map there is a place reserved for the ARK. No other structures can be placed on those tiles.&lt;br/&gt;Player can build an Ark as an Cost 5 Build Action. The Ark costs 12 Money to build. It does not have to be connected to other structures in order to be built. Player can only build the Ark if he already has at least 25 Appeal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ark can hold up to 5 Animals. However each animal has to be of a different Animal Type and different size. F.e. If I have a Long-Billed Vulture in the Ark (which is a size 4 Bird) I can no longer place Birds in the ark and I can no longer place size 4 animals into the Ark. &lt;br/&gt;Once the Ark is build you may move any animals from your zoo to the Ark as long as you fallow the above rules. From now on when you introduce an animal into your zoo you need to decide if it goes into a regular enclosure or the Ark.&lt;br/&gt;Animals in the Ark can't be moved out of Ark (f.e. when Large Build Aviary is build) nor relased with Conservation Projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To track which Animals are already in the Ark place the played Animal Cards above Zoo Map on a dedicated spot according to the animals size. You can also mark the type of animals in the Ark by placing tokens on the respective animal symbols on the ark image on zoo map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you manage to place all 5 animals in the Ark you gain 1 Conservation Point and 2 Reputation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the 7 Appeal for completly building the zoo map you need to build the ARK&lt;br/&gt;The Ark is a size 7 structure for the purpose of the Final Scoring Card that required structures of different size&lt;br/&gt;If you do not build the ARK the reserved tiles count as free tiles for the Naturalistic Final Scoring Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique Conservation Bonus for this map works the same as one of the Bonus tokens introduced in the Marine Wolrd expansion. It allow you to snap one card and increases your hand limit by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Development Biology Center.&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7915288"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ykuORUrv8QViwoNsnJB__A__small/img/-2P5whk5gEWIoBU6dTE9NxYitRY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7915288.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Zoo grants you bonuses based on the amount of research Symbols in your Zoo. In order to receive this bonuses you need to connect the Development Biology Center to your zoo (located in the upper right corner of zoo map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you connect the Development Biology Center to your zoo for each research icon in your zoo place a token from your token pool (unused cubes of your color) on the &quot;Development Track&quot; (lower left corner of the map), starting from the left and gain the associated reward. From now on when you gain a research icon in your zoo place another token on the first free space on the track and gain that reward.&lt;br/&gt;If at any point you will loose a research icon from your zoo remove the rightmost token from the &quot;Development Track&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reward on the track are as fallows:&lt;br/&gt;1. Gain 3 Money&lt;br/&gt;2. Gain a X-token&lt;br/&gt;3. Perform a Gain Action&lt;br/&gt;4. Your hand size limit increases by 1&lt;br/&gt;5. Gain 3 Money on each break&lt;br/&gt;6. Draw a random Alternative Action Card of the type you do not yet own and replace it with a coresponding Standard Action Card&lt;br/&gt;7. Gain 1 Conservation Point&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you already have 7 research symbols, for each new one you get gain 2 Appeal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the zoo map there 2 new placement bonuses:&lt;br/&gt;Red sponsor card - allows you to play a  sponsor from hand by paying it's cost with money as if your sponor card has been upgraded (So you can play a sponsor that requires upgraded sponsor card even if your sponsor card has not been upgraded).&lt;br/&gt;Retrieve Worker - allows you to retrieve a worker from an association board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Map Bonus - Perform a Search action for a sponsor card with a Research Icon. (similiar as when gaining a Univeristy with an animal type)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also special thanks to Godistjuven and Buggy for sharing their maps source files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edits: The Development Biology Center was missing &quot;Construction II&quot; Tiles. Fixed</body>

            <body>These are a lot of fun.  Love the idea of the Ark. I thought there would be a reward for filling it (as it seems really hard) but then realised the reward is the space/money you save just like the averiy and reptile house.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only map I'm not a fan of is the science one. I know you can gain 4 science symbols just with the unis now. But what I love about ark nova is reacting to what cards appear and using them to solve the puzzle. This map seems to force me into a science strategy.  I know the geological map forces you into a strategy to get lots of continents but this is even harder to do. </body>

            <body>Actually there is a reward for filling the Ark 1 Conservation point and 2 Reputation, forgot to mention that in the description. It is however written on the zoo map. Will update the description as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the Science One. There are 2 quite strong placement bonuses on the opposite side of the map (Play upgraded sponsor and retrive worker). You may choose to focus on them instead and gain the science bonuses later when you get some universities.</body>

            <body>Congrats for this new maps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could I ask you something? What's the reason for not adding, in the new Ark nova map (second map) the icon of domestic animal, marine animals o bears? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fingers crossed about new maps hahaha&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Edit: bears not beards hahahahaha</body>

            <body>Marine Animals were not in the original Ark, they can swim 😉&lt;br/&gt;Domestic Animals are special in the game, so it makes sense to continue to treat them that way. Plus technicly they do not have size and require special enclosure. &lt;br/&gt;Beards - I assume you mean Bears - simillar story, they are  a subtype of an animal and are always herbivors or predators.</body>

            <body>The ark gives you not only 7 hexes for only 12 money (much better than Aviary + co), but also houses up to 15 enclosure-size with its 5 animals (5+4+3+2+1), which is really good - the reptile house might house up to 19 enclosure-size, but only if you get all 0-space reptiles and the caiman, which is higly unlikely. The ark is much more flexibel, thus both a great idea and a very tempting goal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science zoo looks very good as well. Research zoo final scoring card encourages you to collect science icons as well. Especially good in combo with Spokesperson and/or Science Lab. There always was a Science icon collecting strategy even in the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for the great new maps!</body>

            <body>I love the Ark idea and like the research idea - if playing the latter, you better grab all the cards that benefit you for other player's research symbols 😅&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not sure about the explorer's map. Can somebody pinpoint me into the direction why so much effort for three card draws should be done?</body>

            <body>We played yesterday and only used fan maps: This page's Ark and the Development Biology Center, and another fan's Landscaping (forgot their name - came here today to look an icon up). This was jolly good fun 😀 The score was 40 - 37 - 10 (i was the 10 and did a few tactical mistakes), so the plans also seem to be balanced out quite well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to all fans for doing this! ❤️ Looking so much into the future to see further fan plans! </body>
