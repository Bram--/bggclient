    <description>When Elsa von Fr&amp;uuml;hlingfeld presented her invention to King Frederik Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power an engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called &amp;ldquo;atomization.&amp;rdquo; Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the next decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science and engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power, demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry the tamed power of the atoms to Saxony&amp;rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers, and industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new industrial revolution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players take role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological boom of 19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a nuclear reactor).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players earn victory points by developing their networks, building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies, giving them special powers when unlocked. Gameplay is continuous; players take turns one after another with no rounds or phases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

        <comment username="ygram" rating="7" value="One play: This is a very economically tight game which I appreciate. The action selection mechanism where you lose action tiles when you build railways is very good and adds an extra dimension.

I was hoping for a lot of interaction but in our first play with tree people it was too low for my taste. We ended up building in three different locations only competing for spots in the end. I am hopeful for next play, perhaps you can grow strong faster by using other peoples infrastructure making competition for city spots tighter." />

        <comment username="yroeht" rating="8" value="The best thing here is the scoring. You need to work on pacing to get optimal amounts of milestones at the right levels (will I score 4x this objective, or this one? can I be the first to a certain tier for the bonus nucleum placement or tier 3 tech?) . There are the contracts, which give you a bonus for taking them, which is interesting and not seen so often. And then, there are the government buildings, which give a lot of importance to expanding networks and blocking others.

The map layout is full of strategic choices (getting access to build spots for mines and turbines, early game connecting to a power plant and energy source)." />

We didn’t realise that the number of triggers needed to end the game was not all 5!    Worth playing.  Not sure if I want to actually buy it knowing how long it is and how long teach was

Worth playing" />

There are 5 end game triggers and the number that need to be met too really trigger end game change with player count and don&apos;t sneak up on you.  Scores increased 150% after the game ended.  Will play again and everyone at the table said the same thing." />
