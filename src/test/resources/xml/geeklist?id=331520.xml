    <title>10 Tips for Gaming with a Brain Injury</title>
    <description>I served in the United States Army as a 19D Cavalry Scout, with one deployment to
        Iraq in 2007. On February 23rd of 2007, I was struck by a pressure plate IED while
        approaching our Observation Post outside of Ramadi, &quot;OP Shadow&quot;, the resulting
        explosion broke my leg, cut me with shrapnel, and gave me a Traumatic Brain Injury. I lost
        about 50-60% of my ability to recall, and my memory is pretty shot, especially short term
        memory. This caused me to have to learn new ways to live life, and perhaps more importantly,
        new ways to be good at board games. I would love to share some of the gaming tips I have
        learned that help me play games with a brain injury. I hope you enjoy my list and the things
        I have learned from my experience.

        <body>Listen, you have got to accept it, your noggin don&apos;t work the same as it used to. Your gonna forget rules, what games you&apos;ve played, what you did on previous turns; hell, your gonna forget if you even liked the games sometimes. Use BGG to help supplement your memory. Rank games right after playing, add notes to remember specific things and thoughts, and keep your collection up to date! It only takes a couple of games not added to easily forget you even have a game.</body>

        <body>Strategy is not your friend, especially in long games. Sure, you can start a game with
            an idea of what you want to do, but it will be gone from your head quicker than that one
            very important thing your spouse told you they really need from the store. Let it go,
            and lean as hard as you can into our next list item!

        <body>If strategy is your enemy, then being tactical is your best friend. The definition
            that applies best here comes from Merriam-Webster:
            (1) : of or relating to small-scale actions serving a larger purpose.
            (2) : made or carried out with only a limited or immediate end in view.

            Your brain thrives on tactical decisions, use that! You already forgot your main
            strategy, so now you are left with different, shorter strategies, like &quot;get points&quot;
            or &quot;make Bradley pay for that hyper-aggressive turn one move that you did nothing
            to deserve&quot;. Just focus on your next turn, no point thinking too far ahead, you
            will just forget your plan anyway.

        <body>There is a special feeling you get when you play a game the very first time. All the
            systems to explore, the fun, deciding if you like or love the game, it&apos;s really
            great! Well good news my friend, you have a super power which let&apos;s you experience
            that with the same game multiple times, at least until you have played it enough times
            that it makes it into your long-term memory. Play a game, wait a month, put it back on
            the table, those poor suckers at the table may remember and prefer to play something
            new, but it is new to you again, so they can live with it!

        <body>Ahh, good old Anomia, the struggle to remember or find a word or name of a thing. This
            is an all-day, everyday occurrence, and it will happen in gaming often. You will forget
            the name of a game, designer, mechanic, etc. When you find your brain cloud is
            completely overcast, feel free to just make up a word, or even better, just point and
            grunt. Gamers are friendly people who will generally just smile and nod when you say
            something dumb, plus, it may just fly if you say it (or grunt it) confidently enough.

        <body>Many times I have finished my turn, had a plan for the next one, and forgotten by the
            time it gets back to my turn. Perhaps your good friend knows you forget stuff, and uses
            this to his advantage by taking some extra time on his turn, &quot;Rob forgets easily,
            so if I milk this turn, he is sure to lose&quot;. Haha, there is a trick for this, so
            you are hoisted by your own petard my friend. The trick? While it is still in your head,
            organize your cards and pieces to remind you of what you wanted to play/use, that way
            you create a system which will guide your tactical decision in the next round!

        <body>What about games in your own collection and rules you need to teach? My tip from
            experience, your never going to remember games that have too many rules, edge cases, and
            rules grit. You have to accept that you may not be the best steward for a game. Hegemony
            was a recent example, I got the game, taught it, then realized I should not be the
            champion for that game. Every time I taught the game I would have to completely relearn
            the rules, and relearn the teach. That&apos;s just not sustainable. So I pawned it off
            to a friend for him to be the teacher/champion. If I want to play, he would be happy to
            GM the game, so that&apos;s a win. Mid to low weight games are your gravy baby!

        <body>Clearly, due to your dumb brain, winning a bunch of games will not be your thing.
            There will obviously be some lucky days, but overall, you are not gonna be the champ
            often. Lean into the friendship and fun with friends and family! It makes every gameday
            awesome, not matter what game gets tabled!
            For those playing with the people this list is about, there is something important to
            know:
            They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression, but when playing with
            a person with a brain injury, you definitely do! Have fun, and if you really want to
            have fun with your new forgetful friend, pick a new name for yourself every time you
            meet them, you will blow their mind!
